These two example sketches are nearly identical. The key difference is the
authentication tokens will be swapped in the two. This example code for the

Using two of these boards to send signals from one board to the other, or from
one connected mobile device to either Blynk Board or another mobile device if
available. Simple wireless buttons and a more complex chat app are part of this
demo.
